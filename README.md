# EasyLandin Digital Marketing Website

This is a modern and responsive website for EasyLandin, a digital marketing agency. It showcases their services, company information, and provides a contact form. The site is built with React and features smooth animations and a clean, professional design to provide an excellent user experience.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using a modern front-end stack:

*   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The entire component-based architecture is built with React and JSX.
*   **React Router**: For declarative routing in the single-page application, allowing for seamless navigation between pages like Home, About, Services, and Contact.
*   **Framer Motion**: A production-ready motion library for React, used for all animations, page transitions, and interactive effects throughout the site.
*   **CSS3**: For styling, utilizing modern features like Flexbox, Grid, and custom properties for a responsive and visually appealing design. The "glassmorphism" effect on some components is also achieved with CSS.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The core language used for the application logic.
